# Implementing an unordered list or linked list.

#imagine a collection of iems, for instance a buch of floating numbers in a cloud. it appears that the numbers are placed randomly. if we hae some imformation on each item,like the location of the next item, then we know the relative position of the item by following the link to the next item.

#we need to know where the first item is, this needs to be explicitly specified. this external reference is referred to as the head of the list. Once we know where the first item is, that can tell us where the second, third, forth item is.

#THE NODE CLASS
#the building block for the linked list is the node. each node object has 2 pieced of info: it must hold the list item itself and a reference to the next node
