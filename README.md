# Python Learning Repository

This repository contains all my progress and projects as I learn and develop my skills in Python programming. It is divided into four folders, each focusing on a specific aspect of Python.

## Folder Structure

### 1. **Syntax and Fundamentals**
This folder includes comprehensive files that cover the basics and intermediate aspects of Python. It serves as a learning reference for Python's core concepts and functionality. Topics covered include:
- **Basics**: Printing, string methods, casting, dealing with inputs, and file handling.
- **Control Flow**: Control statements, loops, and exception handling.
- **Data Structures**: Lists, sets, dictionaries, and indexing.
- **Functions**: Return statements, `*args`, `**kwargs`, lambda functions, and walrus operators.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Principles of OOP, classes, and objects.
- **Advanced Topics**: Threading, multiprocessing, and modules like `time`.
- **GUI Basics**: Labels, buttons, entry boxes, and checkboxes (GUI components).

### 2. **Projects**
This folder contains smaller projects I have created to practice and apply Python programming concepts. These projects demonstrate problem-solving skills and practical application of the language.

### 3. **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**
This folder documents my progress in learning and implementing various data structures and algorithms using Python. It includes:
- Common data structures (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs).
- Algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, recursion).

### 4. **Logic Gates (OOP Implementation)**
This folder contains Python implementations of logic gates using OOP principles. Each logic gate is designed as a class, demonstrating how Python can be used to model and simulate logical operations.

## Getting Started

To explore this repository:
1. Clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python.git

## Future Plans
Add more projects to the Projects folder.
Expand the DSA folder with advanced algorithms.
Develop a more complex OOP-based application.
